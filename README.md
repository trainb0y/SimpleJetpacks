1x Leather Chestplate  

### Usage
To use, hold shift while in midair.

### Fuel
Jetpacks require fuel. One fuel is spent per tick in flight. Fuel is represented in the durability bar (don't worry, the jetpack will never actually break).  
Right clicking with coal in hand while wearing the jetpack adds 100 fuel.

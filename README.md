6x Iron Ingot  
1x Piston  
1x Redstone Block  
1x Chestplate of Jetpack Type 

### Usage
To use, hold shift while in midair.

### Jetpacks
You can define jetpacks in config.yml, which allows you to specify the maximum fuel capacity for each type of jetpack.
The default jetpacks are Iron Chestplate with 1000 fuel capacity, and Leather with 500.

### Fuel
Jetpacks require fuel. One fuel is spent per tick in flight. Fuel is represented in the durability bar (don't worry, the jetpack will never actually break).  
Right clicking with a fuel item (defined in config.yml) in hand while wearing the jetpack adds fuel.
The default fuel items are Coal (100 fuel), Charcoal (100), Redstone Dust (50), and Redstone Blocks (500)
